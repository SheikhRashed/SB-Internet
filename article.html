              <p class="article__text-brief">
                It is not uncommon to hear criticisms of the tech sector for a significant lack of gender diversity at
                all levels, but specifically within decision-making positions.
                <br> <br> 
                According to the World Economic Forum's
                latest Global Gender Gap report, women make up less than 40% of the total workforce in the top tech
                companies, and when considering only tech-related roles they are even more underrepresented.
                <br><br>
                This comes
                at a time when accelerated advances in tech fields like artificial intelligence are having a profound
                impact on the economy and society at large. This is only set to deepen due to the acceleration of
                technological advancements as a result of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
                <br><br>
                But while AI applications
                hold promise to transform our lives in many aspects, they also present serious risks. A narrow talent
                pool in AI could perpetuate existing forms of structural gender inequality. 
                <br><br>
                It should take talent and
                hard work in an individual to have a successful career in Data and AI, as in any industry. But
                certainly, in my experience, it has required more of me. From the time I was interested in mathematics
                as a younger person, it made me different. In university lecture halls, the number of women got leaner
                as we neared graduation. In postgraduate study, there was also the isolation of being the only person of
                colour in all my chosen classes, over and above the gender divide highlighted by the quoted WEF study.
                <br><br>
                The practical impact of this lack of diversity, is that women in university lecture halls either work in
                groups consisting of largely men or get isolated from the collaborative culture that the coding world
                sometimes requires.
                <br><br>
                 It took exposure to the one African and female lecturer I had in the entire course
                of my undergraduate program to show me it was possible and that there was room in the world for some who
                looked like me and had similar interests to myself.
                <br><br>
                Gartner predicts that by 2022, 85% of AI projects
                will deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing
                them.
                <br><br>
                Already we see examples of this in the form of virtual assistants and chatbots that make sexist
                assumptions while there are instances of targeted algorithms that are perpetuating the pay gap by
                gearing better-paid jobs towards men.
                <br><br>
                Taking into consideration that only 22% of AI professionals
                globally are female compared to the 78% who are male, as stated in the WEF report, the picture is
                worrying. In South Africa, on average 28% of the AI talent pool is female in contrast to 72% male.
                Across the rest of Africa, these numbers are expected to be even lower.
                <br><br>
                The impact of this bias in AI is
                well-documented. Individuals are profiled with unfavorable consequences, access to important services is
                compromised. And all the gaps widen: the gap between exposure to the profession and the people it seeks
                to attract, as the image of participation and leadership in our sector is maintained rather than
                transformed to be more inclusive. Bias accelerates the divide. At best, the status quo is maintained. At
                worse, inclusivity becomes even more elusive. It is an ethical question of what comprises the right
                data; over and above what is necessary and sufficient. 
                <br><br>

                This emphasises the urgent need to take action
                that incorporates awareness, improved education, transformation, inclusivity and enablement for females.
                <br><br>
                As companies race to expand their digital capabilities by leveraging disruptive technologies like AI,
                cloud computing, big data and others to remain competitive and relevant in the current environment,
                there will be an ever-greater demand for technical skills and innovation capacity.
                <br><br>
                This is especially
                true for the financial services industry, where significant investments are being made to enhance
                customer experience and engagement through new digital capabilities. Billions are being spent on
                catching our continent up to world standards in data and AI, necessarily so. AI is an area of
                development in which self-advocacy is critical. With the rapid change in pace of development, with a
                race to reach the unbanked, and with several women's propositions being created, recognizing the pivotal
                role women make as decision makers in homes across the continent, it is evident that unless these
                propositions speak to the end user, these massive investments may limit the very value they seek to
                create, by design.
                <br><br>
                For more women to enter this talent pool requires us to break down the opposition
                that so many women experience. The WEF report shows that there is still a perception among 52% of women
                that technology is a male industry, while almost a third (32%) believe gender bias is still a major
                hurdle in the recruitment process. 
                <br><br>
                Standard Bank recognizes this and has several Women's Leadership
                development programs, that invest significantly in the growth and development of women in the
                organization.
                <br><br>
                As we enter the new wave of industrialisation, we must do better as an industry to remove
                unconscious bias to create a more inclusive environment. The most effective route to success is when
                teams are diverse in their representation and this starts at the top. 
                <br><br>
                We need to open dialogue around
                the pervasive stereotypes around gender.
                <br><br>
                 At Standard Bank, we have been on our own journey to promote
                inclusion and gender equality both internally and in the wider financial services ecosystem. We
                participate in programmes and drive initiatives designed to provide both women and men the opportunity
                to enhance their capabilities in skills of the future such as data science and analytics.
                <br><br>
                
                Standard
                Bank's Data Science Mastery programme, launched in 2016, provides practical experience to greenfield
                graduates and experienced staff members, who are fused together and exposed to different areas of the
                business where unique problems exist. The mentorship aspect of the programme, which is diverse in
                nature, plays an instrumental role in establishing a diverse talent pool within the organisation.  
                <br><br>
                
                The
                structural bias we see in the Data and AI profession currently is a reflection of the structural biases
                that exist in society. To shift them, we shift society. To shift society, we expose all young people as
                widely as possible, and foster environments that they can grow their potential and their curiosity.
                <br><br>
                The
                world is facing a digital skills gap and gender plays little role in this regard. As men and women, we
                must empower ourselves with the skills needed to stay relevant in the future of work. In this era, the
                onus is on everyone to pursue education and keep abreast of evolving trends.
